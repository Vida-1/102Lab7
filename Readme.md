# This is lab 07. 

* In lab 1 we created a reading-notes repo
* In lab 2 we set up our computers with the various software and access credentials needed to move forward with this class.
* In lab 3 we cloned down our reading-notes repo to work from a local repository, we also made general cleanups and updates to same.
* In lab 4 we were paired with a classmate to generate a wireframe and HTML code to render the wireframe's structure.
* In lab 5 we were again paired with a classmate to recreate the wireframe and generate a styline plan to be applied to it via an external CSS stylesheet
* In lab 6 we to: Add at least 3 dynamic components to your web page. These can be based on user input, or other dynamic input data.

* **For lab 7 we are to:**

<img src="2714.svg" width="10px"/> Use functions to improve the clarity and readability of your code.

<img src="2714.svg" width="10px"/> Wrap related steps into a single function. Be sure you are properly defining the function, calling it, and getting the return value you expect.

<img src="2714.svg" width="10px"/> Can you see how you might use just a single <script> tag with a src attribute to access your JS, and then specific function calls throughout the rest of your page?

<img src="274C.svg" width="10px"/> Add a check to the user input you are getting, to see if the initial user input is an acceptable value. If not, present the user with an error message and a second chance to enter a proper value.

<img src="274C.svg" width="10px"/> Stretch Goal: Using only conditionals and functions, modify your input validation code to continue checking the user input until the value entered is acceptable.

* Submission Instructions: Share in the discussion a part of the code you are most proud of. Explain here how it came to be, and why you like it. Check out what your classmates did!
