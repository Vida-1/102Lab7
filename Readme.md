# This is lab 07. 

In lab 1 we created a reading-notes repo
In lab 2 we set up our computers with the various software and access credentials needed to move forward with this class.
In lab 3 we cloned down our reading-notes repo to work from a local repository, we also made general cleanups and updates to same.
In lab 4 we were paired with a classmate to generate a wireframe and HTML code to render the wireframe's structure.
In lab 5 we were again paired with a classmate to recreate the wireframe and generate a styline plan to be applied to it via an external CSS stylesheet
In lab 6 we to: 
Add at least 3 dynamic components to your web page. These can be based on user input, or other dynamic input data.
  At least one dynamic component should be based on user input.
  At least one dynamic component should use a conditional statement to determine the output.
  Stretch Goal: Try out the confirm() function, in addition to prompt(). Whenâ€™s the right time to use this?
  Stretch Goal: If the user gives you a color, can you set a part of your page to be that color?
  
I fell short on Draft one of lab 6 but will try to improve it.

#### **For lab 7 we are to:**
* Use functions to improve the clarity and readability of your code.
* Wrap related steps into a single function. Be sure you are properly defining the function, calling it, and getting the return value you expect.
* Can you see how you might use just a single <script> tag with a src attribute to access your JS, and then specific function calls throughout the rest of your page?
* Add a check to the user input you are getting, to see if the initial user input is an acceptable value. If not, present the user with an error message and a second chance to enter a proper value.
* Stretch Goal: Using only conditionals and functions, modify your input validation code to continue checking the user input until the value entered is acceptable.

* Submission Instructions: Share in the discussion a part of the code you are most proud of. Explain here how it came to be, and why you like it. Check out what your classmates did!
